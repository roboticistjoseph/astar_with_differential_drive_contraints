User Dependencies:
-> Python 3.9
-> IDE to run the program (I used VSCode)
-> Libraries : numpy, argparse, matplotlib.pyplot, time, matplotlib.patches,heapq

Instructions to run:
-> Open an IDE
-> Navigate to the folder where the .py file exists
-> Upon running the code, the user will be prompted to enter coordinates, please have one space between the values.
-> To visualize the exploration and path as a video, please uncomment the plt.pause() on line 316
-> The visuzaliztion using matplotlib is a bit slower so, to view the result, just run it.
-> It will take some time to generate the plot. Thank you for being Patient.

Code:
-> The code describes how to implement A star algorithm on a differential drive robot
-> We added differential drive constraints and plot curve fucntions as an extension to our Project 3 phase1

Output:
--> The map will be plotted with explored nodes and
